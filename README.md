ðŸš— Smart Parking Lot System

This is a Smart Parking Lot Management System that helps manage parking spots, vehicles, floors, and fee calculations.
It automatically allocates parking spaces based on vehicle size, tracks entry and exit times, and calculates fees in real time.

Features

1. Parking Spot Allocation

Automatically assigns the nearest available parking spot to incoming vehicles.

Supports multiple vehicle types: Motorcycle, Car, Bus.

Spots are categorized by size: Motorcycle, Compact, Regular, and Large.

Add up to 3 more floors (maximum 4 floors total).

Each floor automatically contains:

20 Motorcycle spots

80 Compact spots

40 Regular spots

3. Vehicle Entry & Exit Panels

Entry Panel: Records vehicle entry, assigns a parking spot, and generates a unique transaction ID.
